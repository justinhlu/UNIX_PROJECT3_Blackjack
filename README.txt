// DESCRIPTION: This is a program that runs a text-based version of the 
// popular casino card game Blackjack! Comprehensive rules can be found
// in the reference section, but our version is a simplified version of
// the game. 
//
// RULES: The player starts with $1000.00 that they can use to bet. If
// they use all of it, they lose and can't keep playing. After making a
// bet, the dealer "deals" a hand of two cards to the player and to
// himself, but only one of the player's cards is revealed to the player.
// The goal of the game is to get a higher hand value than the dealer
// without going over 21. If either the player or the house goes over 21,
// they bust and they lose! After the initial dealing of the hands, the
// player can choose to either "stand" and hope that their hand is high
// enough, or they can "hit" and draw a new card from the deck. The round
// is over when both the dealer's turn and the player's turn is over. If
// the player wins, they gain they have their bet value added to their
// money pool. After the round is over, the player can choose to keep playing with
// money they have or "walk away" and quit playing.
